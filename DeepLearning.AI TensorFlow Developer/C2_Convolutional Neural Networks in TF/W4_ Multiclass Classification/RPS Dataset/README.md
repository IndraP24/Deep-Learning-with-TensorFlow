# Rock Paper Scissors Dataset

Rock Paper Scissors contains images from various hands, from different races, ages, and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labeled as such. You can download the [training set here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps.zip) and the [test set here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-test-set.zip). [Laurence Moroney](https://laurencemoroney.com/about.html), Lead AI Advocate at Google, created these images using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a model trained on a CGI-based dataset could classify real images. He also generated a few pictures that can be used for predictions. You can [find them here](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-validation.zip).

Note that all of these pictures use a plain white background. Each image is **`300Ã—300`** pixels in **`24-bit`** color. Examples Here are a few examples showing some of the poses and the diversity of hands used.
