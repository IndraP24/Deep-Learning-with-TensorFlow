# TensorFlow Tutorial

## Overview

This repo contains all the notebooks I made and used while studying Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2. It includes the following:

- Introduction to Neural Networks with TF
- Convolutional Neural Networks with TF
- Natural Language Processing with TF
- Sequence and Time Series with TF

I have also built a webpage in an attempt to deploy all the ready-to-serve models to it for Users to try them out using the data of their choice.
